# Contributing to Carbon Native

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Carbon Native and its
packages, which are hosted in the Carbon Native Organization on GitHub. These
are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

**Notes on Contribution**

As you create new or update existing components you need to write a test for
them and fit a demo of them into the Kitchen Sink app.

**Notes on Structure**

You can find the raw Carbon Native components under `./src` the Kitchen Sink
demo app screens can be found under `./screens` and the tests for both `src` and
`screens` can be found under `__tests__`.

**Notes on Deployment**

To deploy Carbon Native we use a shell script (`publish.sh`) that ultimately
just publishes to NPM. Only specified organizations admins should have access to
publish on NPM:

* Tyler Buchea
* Josh Buchea

After publishing you have to manually update the root `package.json` file to
match the new version in `./dist/package.json`, commit, and push the change.

To deploy the Kitchen Sink app to Expo you will need the Expo CLI tool `npm
install -g exp` after that you can run `exp publish`. Only specified
organizations admins should have access to publish on Expo:

* Tyler Buchea
* Josh Buchea
